            <p>When planning out a healthy diet, it’s common to focus on foods geared toward weight loss.
                 While smart caloric intake is vital to overall health, it’s also important to understand 
                 how food choices affect your brain. By integrating many of the foods on this list into your diet,
                not only will you see positive results in your waistline, but you’ll also improve brain function — 
                and potentially help fight cognitive diseases as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                Conversely, an inadequate diet can lead to fatigue, impaired decision-making, and can slow down reaction time.
                 In fact, a poor diet can actually aggravate, and may even lead to, stress and depression.

                        <h2>Salmon</h2>
                        <p>While fish, in general, is a healthy choice, salmon is at the top of the list.
                             It’s a “fatty” fish, containing high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been linked to a 
                             reduction in mental disorders such as depression. Omega-3s have been shown to boost learning and memory as well.

                            Salmon also has a naturally high-occurring amount of vitamin D, which is often added to foods and has been linked to lower rates of depression. 
                            Other types of fish with high Omega-3 counts include tuna, mackerel, and herring.

                        <h2>Grains</h2>
                        <p>
                            Many types of food fall under this category, like beans, soy, oats and wild rice. 
                            While your body and brain utilize carbohydrates for energy, too often we consume simple carbs,
                             which lead to blood sugar spikes. Foods classified as whole grains contain complex carbohydrates,
                              which leads to glucose being produced more slowly, as a more even and consistent source of energy.

                            Also, whole grains help the brain absorb tryptophan, which means that when eaten in conjunction 
                            with foods like chicken and turkey, you can further reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety while
                             boosting brain function.

                        <h2>Avocados</h2>
                        <p>
                            Avocados are full of vitamin K and folate, which help protect your brain against stroke.
                             They also provide a boost to your memory and concentration.

                            Avocados serve up a high dose of lutein, too, which studies have linked to improved brain function.

                        <h2>Spinach</h2>
                        <p>
                            Spinach and other leafy greens provide your brain with solid amounts of folic acid,
                             which has been shown to be a great deterrent to depression. It also helps fight off insomnia,
                              which is heavily linked to mental impairments and can help reduce dementia in older adults.

                        <h2>Yogurt</h2>
                        <p>
                            Yogurt and other products containing active cultures are excellent sources of probiotics. 
                            Often associated with digestive health, probiotics have been shown to play a role in reducing stress and anxiety.

                            Yogurt can also provide you with potassium and magnesium, which helps oxygen reach the brain,
                             further improving its ability to function.

                        <p>
                            Like salmon, nuts are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, helping to fight depression. 
                            Cashews, for example, help provide oxygen to the brain with a dose of magnesium.

                            Almonds contain a compound called phenylalanine, which is shown to help the brain produce 
                            dopamine and other neurotransmitters that boost your mood. Phenylalanine has also been linked 
                            to a reduction in the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease.

                        <h2>Olive Oil</h2>
                        <p>
                            Pure, extra virgin olive oil has been quite popular as of late as a part of healthy Mediterranean-style 
                            diets. This type of oil contains polyphenols, which help to remove the effects of proteins linked to 
                            Alzheimer’s Disease. It can also help improve learning and memory.

                            Be careful when shopping for olive oil, however. Many brands liberally cut their product with 
                            vegetable or seed oils, significantly reducing its brain health benefits. Research brands online to 
                            find brands tested to ensure they contain pure olive oil.

                        <h2>Tomatoes</h2>
                        <p>
                            The source of a tomato’s red hue, lycopene is classified as an all-around beneficial 
                            phytonutrient. One of the many health boosts it provides is in the fight against brain 
                            disease. It’s been shown to delay the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s Disease, fighting
                             off cell damage.

                            In addition, lycopene has been shown to help with memory, attention, logic and concentration.

                        <h2>Chicken</h2>
                        <p>
                            Chicken, like turkey, is a delicious lean-protein choice containing the amino acid tryptophan.
                             Though it’s often associated with post-Thanksgiving naps, this substance doesn’t actually knock 
                             you out as urban legends go, but it does help your body produce serotonin — which is vital in
                              helping your brain manage your mood, fight depression and help maintain strong memory.

                        <h2>Dark Chocolate</h2>
                        <p>
                            Could this be the best news on the list? Dark chocolate is categorized as such due to 
                            its cocoa content, which you won’t find in milk chocolate. And the darker the better — 85% cocoa
                             or more is the most beneficial.

                            Dark chocolate contains high levels of flavonoids, a type of antioxidant.
                             It has been shown to boost attention and memory, enhance mood and help fight cognitive
                              decline in older adults. Just remember, chocolate should still be consumed in moderation.
