                When it comes to exercise, the physical benefits are well-documented, 
                from lowering blood pressure and your risk of some diseases to improving your physical appearance.
                Increasingly, the spotlight is being shone on the mental health benefits of working out, such as boosting 
                your mood, improving sleep and easing symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression.
            </p>

            <p>
                Science backs this up. One study found that increasing your activity levels from doing nothing, 
                to exercising at least three times a week, reduces the risk of depression by up to 30 per cent. 
                Another study found that individuals who engaged in exercise had 43% lower self-reported 'poor mental 
                health' days than those who did not.

                            'Outdoor exercise or eco-therapy can be particularly beneficial and research suggests it 
                            can actually be as effective as antidepressants in treating mild to moderate depression,'
                             says Mind Information Manager, Rachel Boyd.<br><br>
                             Two 2007 studies commissioned by MIND revealed that 94 per cent said outdoor activities 
                             including running and walking had benefited their mental health, so for best results avoid the treadmill.

                        <p>
                            The mental health benefits of Pilates often get overlooked because of the traditional
                             focus on Pilates for back health and core strength.
                            <br><br>
                            'Joseph Pilates (Pilates' founder), believed so strongly in the connection between 
                            physical and mental health, he originally called his system of exercise 'Controlology',
                             ie the control of the body with the mind,' says Karen Laing, a Pilates Instructor who has
                              battled anxiety.

                        <h2>Yoga</h2>
                        <p>
                            When you lift weights, your muscles get stronger and bigger. When you do yoga, your
                            brain cells develop new connections, and changes occur in brain struc­ture as well as 
                            function, resulting in improved cog­nitive skills, such as learning and memory.
                              <br><br>

                            Studies using MRI scans and other brain imaging technology have shown that people who 
                            regularly did yoga had a thicker cerebral cortex (the area of the brain responsible for
                             information processing) and hippocampus (the area of the brain involved in learn­ing and 
                             memory) compared with nonpractitioners. These areas of the brain typically shrink as you 
                             age, but the older yoga practitioners showed less shrinkage than those who did no yoga. 
                             This suggests that yoga may counteract age-related declines in memory and other cognitive
                              skills.

                        <h2>Swimming</h2>
                        <p>
                            A recent study showed that being immersed in water boosts the blood flow to the brain. 
                            This increases the supply of oxygen, glucose and nutrients which would suggest a positive 
                            impact on brain health.
                            <br><br>
                            A scientific study carried out by the Griffith Institute for Educational Research found that
                             children who learn to swim earlier reach major cognitive developmental milestones – 
                             including oral expression, literacy, numeracy and visual motor skills – earlier than their
                              peers and non-swimmers.

                        <h2>Cycling</h2>
                        <p>
                            Cycling can grow your brain in the same way it can grow your muscles. Blood flow to the brain increases
                             just as it does with the muscles, bringing in more oxygen and nutrients that can improve its performance.
                             <br><br>

                            Riding increases the production of proteins used for creating new brain cells by two or three times 
                            the norm! It also increases the activities that allow the different regions of our brain to communicate 
                            more effectively.
                            
                            Cycling has also been shown to counteract the natural decline of brain function and development as we age.

                            Most of us are familiar with the great feeling obtained from spending time out on the dance 
                            floor. From weddings and holiday parties to aerobic classes or even dance lessons, moving our
                             body often does a lot to lift our mood. It turns out there is a scientific explanation behind
                              those mood-boosting moves, and there are ways we can use dance to improve our mental health.
                            <br><br>
                            There are many benefits of dance supported by research. Dance improves your heart health,
                             overall muscle strength, balance and coordination, and reduces depression.

                            Boxing is a positive method of relieving stress. When hitting the heavy bag, you’re engaged
                             and not in your head. You’re completely focused on the power behind your punches and the
                              technique used for every combo. It clears your mind and leaves you feeling much calmer than
                               you were before your workout.
                             <br><br>
                             Boxing will give you the confidence boost you didn’t know you needed. When you’re hitting 
                             the heavy bag, you feel invincible! With every punch, empowerment and confidence washes over
                              you.
